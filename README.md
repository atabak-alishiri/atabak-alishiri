### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hello, world! I'm Atabak, a multidisciplinary maverick with a blend of engineering acumen 🛠️, business savvy 📊, and a voracious appetite for technology and innovation. Originally hailing from the poetic landscapes of Iran, I'm now soaking up the energy of Vancouver, Canada. A linguistic aficionado, I converse in English, Farsi, and Azeri, with Turkish in my linguistic arsenal.

### 🎓 My Educational Odyssey

- **Bachelor's in Engineering**: Where I learned that everything can be fixed with duct tape, except relationships.
- **Master's in Construction Management**: Mastering the art of telling people, "Yes, we're still on schedule".
- **MBA Studies**: Where I realized that the real ROI was the friends we made along the way.
- **Master of Data Science**: Venturing into the realm of data, because why stop at two master's degrees when you can make it a hat-trick?

### 👔 Professional Experience

- **Cross-Industry Expertise**: Navigating from tech startups to construction behemoths, I've donned roles like Marketing Director, Head of Growth, and Executive Manager.
- **Digital Marketing Maven**: I spin digital strategies like a DJ, creating vibes that resonate with audiences, drive engagement, and sometimes even make them dance.
- **Analytical Skills**: Diving into data analysis, market research, and wielding tools like Google Analytics, SEMrush, and Adobe Suite like a modern-day wizard.

### 📚 Passion for Knowledge

- **Personal Blog**: At [Atabak Notes](https://atabaknotes.com/), I explore the intricacies of business strategies, the digital marketing cosmos, and the fine art of being better every day.
- **Lifelong Learner**: Forever curious, always diving deeper into technology, marketing, and the endless ocean of business intelligence.
